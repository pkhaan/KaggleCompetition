    "# Introduction to Deep Learning Using Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high-level API for deep learning. It is written in Python and can run on top of [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), two very popular libraries for neural networks in Python. It allows users to implement deep learning models very fast and with minimum effort. In the past years, the contribution of Keras to research in deep learning has been significant since it has allowed researchers to go from ideas to results with the least possible delay.\n",

    "In this part of the lab, we will implement a simple feedforward neural network to perform classification on a synthetic dataset. Your first objective is to create a toy dataset. The dataset will consist of 200 points in the 2-dimensional space (N = 200, d = 2). Each point will belong either to class 0 or to class 1. Each class will contain exactly 100 points. For class 0, points will be drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean [1,1] and standard deviation 0.5. For class 1, points will be drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean [-1,-1] and standard deviation 0.5. To generate these values make use of the [`randn`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.randn.html) function of NumPy that returns a sample from the \"standard normal\" distribution as follows: \n",
