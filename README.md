# INF131 Challenge 2022: Citation Prediction
Build a model to predict whether a paper cites another paper

In Network Theory, Link Prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in 
a Network. Examples of Link Prediction include predicting friendship links among users in a Social Network, predicting
co-authorship links in a Citation Network, and predicting interactions between genes and proteins in a Biological
Network.

Predicting whether a Citation Link exists between two papers is a significant analysis task and a fundamental
link prediction problem. The approach we utilized prioritizes an increase to the Accuracy of the Model by using a combination 
of Features from each aspect of our Data-set. The final version of our Model and all relative files are
available through this Repository.
